## üìå Introduction
The core objective of this project is to develop and orchestrate an automated pipeline for forecasting energy consumption across eleven European countries, namely Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The pipeline is specifically tailored for processing hourly energy consumption data.

This project is fully integrated within the Azure Cloud ecosystem and leverages the power and scalability of the Databricks platform. Utilizing these cutting-edge cloud technologies ensures that the pipeline is not only highly scalable but also incredibly efficient and reliable.

Forecasting energy consumption is pivotal for European countries, as it plays an instrumental role in ensuring energy sustainability, optimizing power generation and distribution, and facilitating informed decision-making. By producing reliable and timely forecasts, this project empowers energy providers and stakeholders with insights that can lead to cost reductions, enhanced operational efficiencies, and the promotion of sustainable energy practices.

The end goal is to establish a robust, scalable, and automated solution that provides precise forecasting of energy consumption. Through automating the forecasting process, we aim to keep up with the ever-evolving demands of the energy sector and contribute significantly to Europe‚Äôs broader economic and environmental objectives.

## üîç Aim of the Project

## üéØ Aim of the Project

The primary aim of this project is to create a robust and scalable solution for forecasting energy consumption across 11 European countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland) on an hourly basis. The motivation behind forecasting energy consumption is to help utilities, grid operators, and consumers in these countries in better planning and managing energy resources which is crucial for sustainability and efficiency.

Here are the specific objectives that this project aims to accomplish:

- **Automate Data Acquisition**: The project automates the process of acquiring the relevant energy consumption data from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, which is an authoritative source for European energy market data.

- **Data Processing and Feature Engineering**: Processing the raw data to engineer features that are significant for forecasting models. This includes handling any missing or inconsistent data and engineering new features that might improve the performance of the forecasting models.

- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Building forecasting models using various machine learning algorithms. These models are then evaluated using relevant metrics to quantify their performance.

- **Scalability and Performance**: The solution is built on the Azure cloud and Databricks platform to ensure that it is scalable and can handle large volumes of data efficiently.

- **Deployment and Monitoring**: Once a suitable model is developed, it is deployed to make forecasts available for end-users. Additionally, the project incorporates monitoring tools to keep track of the model‚Äôs performance over time.

By achieving these objectives, the project contributes to the broader goal of optimizing energy consumption, which has substantial economic and environmental benefits.

## üìà Results and Findings

This section presents the results and findings obtained through the energy consumption forecasting pipeline. The results are categorized into explanatory analysis, average hourly consumption analysis, model comparison, and evaluation metrics for the deployed model.

### Explanatory Analysis

#### Daily Energy Consumption(e.g. Greece)

Explanatory data analysis is essential for understanding the patterns and trends in the dataset. Below is a plot illustrating daily energy consumption in Greece. The plot reveals seasonality and trends in energy consumption, which are crucial for accurate forecasting.

*Daily Energy Consumption in Greece.*

### Average Hourly Consumption by Country and Hour of Day

The plot below provides insights into average hourly energy consumption by country and hour of day. This is crucial to understand which countries consume more energy at different times of the day and can guide resource allocation and energy production planning.

*Average Hourly Consumption by Country and Hour of Day.*

### Model Comparison: Daily Staging & Production Model Comparison for Greece

To evaluate and select the best model for forecasting, we compared the daily staging and production models. The plot below illustrates how closely each model's predictions match the actual energy consumption data(For the sake of the example we illustrate data from Greece for the 1st week of April)

*Daily Staging & Production Model Comparison for Greece over one week.*

### Evaluation Metrics for Deployed Model

The current deployed model was evaluated based on various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R¬≤). These metrics provide a quantitative understanding of the model's performance in forecasting energy consumption.

- **MSE**: 24742781.8
- **MAE**: 1859.5
- **RMSE**: 4974.2
- **R¬≤**: 0.994
- **Training Time**: 134.2 sec

These findings and insights are instrumental for utility companies, policy-makers, and consumers in making informed decisions regarding energy consumption, production, and resource allocation.
