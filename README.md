## 📌 Introduction
This project aims to create an automated energy consumption forecasting system using Databricks and machine learning algorithms. The system predicts energy consumption for multiple regions in the United States using historical data and updates its predictions in real-time. By providing accurate forecasts, energy companies can optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve sustainability.
